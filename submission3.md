## Lab 3 report
### Task 1
First, i've made some comits in lab3 branch and pushed them to the origin.

```shell
touch dummy.txt
```
```shell
git add --all
git commit -m "minor: added empty .txt"
git push --set-upstream origin lab3
```
Next, I checked the hash of the current commit in HEAD. 
```shell
 git rev-parse HEAD

dd10c3fabdb52058e3e7d6f115c86004e8f17422
```

Let's check the content of hash:

```shell
git cat-file -p dd10c3fabdb52058e3e7d6f115c86004e8f17422
```
```
tree e7e37c59d9a07d3f2fc9faf179e5f03117a3198b
parent 5916f2682554fb755d1b38992d1875cb948561f3
author Kirill <k.glinsky@innopolis.university> 1719340754 +0300
committer Kirill <k.glinsky@innopolis.university> 1719340754 +0300

minor: added text to dummy.txt
```

Here we can find the hash of the tree. Let's inspect it:

```shell
git cat-file -p e7e37c59d9a07d3f2fc9faf179e5f03117a3198b
```
```

100644 blob 793bb19cd158fae333205f524eba5adc16718c58	lab6.md
```

Let's inspect the blob of the latest file:

```shell
git cat-file -p edaff9260ede06dbc15b1ec165f14d002cb400f3
```
```
some dummy text
```
### Task 2
First we create new branch. For now it is stored locally, not up to date with main from origin.
```
git checkout -b git-reset-practice
```
```
Switched to a new branch 'git-reset-practice'
```
Next, we add series of commits to this branch. Commits go one by one.

```
echo "First commit" > file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "First commit"
```
```
[git-reset-practice 5b1253a] First commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 file.txt
```
```
echo "Second commit" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Second commit"
```
```
[git-reset-practice f9451af] Second commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```
```
echo "Third commit" >> file.txt
git add file.txt
git commit -m "Third commit"
```
```
[git-reset-practice 415b65f] Third commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

After that, we use ```git reset --soft HEAD~1``` to remove last commit, but still keep changes locally in our working directoryy.
After that, we use ```git reset --hard HEAD~1``` to remove both last commit and local changes.

```HEAD is now at 5b1253a First commit```

Now we are in the commit with the hash 5b1253a - our first insertion to file.txt. 

Let's use **reflog** to see how our HEAD have changed with time. It includes all changes of HEAD starting from the cloning of repo:

```
git reflog
```
```shell
5b1253a (HEAD -> git-reset-practice) HEAD@{0}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
f9451af HEAD@{1}: reset: moving to HEAD~1
415b65f HEAD@{2}: commit: Third commit
f9451af HEAD@{3}: commit: Second commit
5b1253a (HEAD -> git-reset-practice) HEAD@{4}: commit: First commit
dd10c3f (origin/lab3, lab3) HEAD@{5}: checkout: moving from lab3 to git-reset-practice
dd10c3f (origin/lab3, lab3) HEAD@{6}: commit: minor: added text to dummy.txt
5916f26 HEAD@{7}: commit: minor: added empty .txt
73e47a9 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) HEAD@{8}: checkout: moving from master to lab3
73e47a9 (origin/master, origin/HEAD, master) HEAD@{9}: clone: from https://github.com/PurplePegasuss/Sum24-intro-labs.git
```

Here we can see exactly what happened - 3 new commits + 2 resets reverting back to the 5b1253a.

Let's switch back to the times before those 3 commits:

```
git reset --hard  dd10c3f
```
```
HEAD is now at dd10c3f minor: added text to dummy.txt
```

That's it!

**reflog** is used to see how our HEAD have changed with time.

**git reset** is used to move the HEAD pointer to the chosen hash\head_id commit + removes files in working directory if --hard is chosen, and doesn't remove if --soft is chosen.
